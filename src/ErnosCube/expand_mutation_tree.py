    In general, a cube is essentially unique in comparison with a collection of

    A naÃ¯ve implementation of this function would compare the candidate with
    every cube inserted into the mutation tree thus far. This function does not
    do that. Rather, the cube is compared with all cubes inserted thus far in
    the current layer, and all cubes in the previous two layers.

    Justification: In general, a cube at layer N (for N>0) mutated by 1 turn
    may result in a cube at layer N-1, N or N+1. A candidate cube at layer N+1
    only needs to be compared against the previous 2 layers since it is
    impossible that a cube isomorphic to the candidate would exist in layer
    N-2.
